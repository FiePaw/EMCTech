# EMCTech

EMCTech is the successor to EquivalencyTech and EMC2 and acts as a 'merger' of both addons including fixes for the
problems that were present in both.

A more detailed description of mechanics and EMC can be found on my
wiki [here](https://docs.sefiraat.dev/emctech/what-is-emc)

## EMC

This addon lets you dematerialize any valid items into EMC. EMC is a form of currency that is tied to the player and can
be used to form new items using a Materializer.

There are 5 tiers of both Materializer and Dematerializer which increasingly difficult crafting recipes. Each tier has a
higher power capacity which, in turn, allows for a wider variety of items to be run through them.

An item must be 'learned' before you can Materialize it. This is a simple process as items are automatically learned the
first time you dematerialize them.
